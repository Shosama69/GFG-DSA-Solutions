Problem: Append To List
Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/append-to-list/

Description:
You are given three inputs a, b, c. You need to create a list and append a, b, c to the list and then return that list.

Example:
Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 1 2 3

Approach:
We can directly return the list with all three values in it.
We can append all the items one by one and then return the list.

    return [a,b,c]
